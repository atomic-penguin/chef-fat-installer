= ABOUT CHEF FAT INSTALLER

 * Uses rvm, see http://rvm.beginrescueend.com
 * Installs chef-client, Ruby, and gems in a self-contained distribution
 * For limited support contact the author of this distribution.

= USAGE NOTES

Run 'build-installer', which should output a makeself .run file

The makeself directory contains the makeself files necessary to build the .run file

The buildroot directory contains the files and installer script.  Everything
in this directory, buildroot, gets rolled up into the FAT installer.

== WARNINGS

Chances are this deployment could be destructive to an existing rvm environment.
It shouldn't overwrite the default location of /usr/local/rvm, instead it installs
in /opt/chef.  However, the installer could override your default rvm installation.

I have tried to keep separate filenames from rvm to avoid conflict.  Files, and directories
of interest.

 * /opt/chef - Installation path
 * /etc/profile.d/chef-rvm.sh - Profile script
 * /etc/chef-rvmrc - exports rvm path for Chef
